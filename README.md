*NB: This is nbdev v2, a major upgrade of nbdev. Whilst the differences
to nbdev1 aren’t huge, it does require some changes. The old version
docs are at [nbdev1.fast.ai](https://nbdev1.fast.ai). You can use
version-pinning in `settings.ini` (i.e `'nbdev<2'`) to stop nbdev from
upgrading. To upgrade, follow the [migration
tutorial](https://nbdev.fast.ai/migrating.html).*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

`nbdev` is a system for *exploratory programming*. Simply write
notebooks with lightweight markup and get high-quality documentation,
tests, continuous integration, and packaging for free!

`nbdev` makes debugging and refactoring your code much easier than in
traditional programming environments since you always have live objects
at your fingertips. `nbdev` also promotes software engineering best
practices because tests and documentation are first class.

-   **Documentation** is automatically generated using
    [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and hosted on [GitHub
    Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Docs support LaTeX, are
    searchable, and are automatically hyperlinked (including
    out-of-the-box support for many packages via
    [`nbdev-index`](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev-index)). You also
    have fine-grained control over how cells are displayed.
-   **Publish packages to PyPI and conda** as well as tools to simplify
    package releases. Python best practices are automatically followed,
    for example, only exported objects are included in `__all__`
-   **Two-way sync between notebooks and plaintext** source code
    allowing you to use your IDE for code navigation or quick edits.
-   **Tests** written as ordinary notebook cells are run in parallel
    with a single command. You have fine-grained control over which
    tests are run.
-   **Continuous integration** out-of-the-box with [GitHub
    Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) that run your tests on
    each push and rebuild docs on each merge.
-   **Git-friendly notebooks** with tools that clean unwanted metadata
    and render merge conflicts in a human-readable format.
-   … and much more!

## Install

nbdev works on macOS, Linux, and most Unix-style operating systems. It
works on Windows under WSL, but not under cmd or Powershell.

You can install nbdev with pip:

    pip install nbdev

… or with conda (or mamba):

    conda install -c fastai nbdev

Note that `nbdev` must be installed into the same Python environment
that you use for both Jupyter and your project.

## How to use nbdev

The best way to learn to use nbdev is to complete one of these tutorials
(we suggest replicating each step to solidify your understanding):

**Video step-by-step walkthru** (to view full screen, click the little

(There’s an [alternate version of the
walkthru](https://youtu.be/67FdzLSt4aA) available with the coding
sections sped up using the `unsilence` python library – it’s 27 minutes
faster, but it’s be harder to follow along with.)

## Installing Quarto

Note that when you setup your first project, nbdev will attempt to
automatically download and install [quarto](https://quarto.org/) for
you. This is the program that we use to create your documentation
website.

Quarto’s standard installation process requires root access, and nbdev
will therefore ask for your root password during installation. For most
people, this will work fine and everything will be handled automatically
– if so, you can skip over the rest of this section, which talks about
installing without root access.

If you need to install quarto without root access on Linux, first `cd`
to wherever you want to store it, then [download
quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/), and type:

``` bash
dpkg -x quarto*.deb .
mv opt/quarto ./
rmdir opt
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
ln -s "$(pwd)"/quarto/bin/quarto ~/.local/bin
```

To use this non-root version of quarto, you’ll need `~/.local/bin` in
your [`PATH` environment
variable](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-add-directory-to-path-in-linux/).
(Alternatively, change the `ln -s` step to place the symlink somewhere
else in your path.)

## FAQ

### Q: What is the warning “Found a cell containing mix of imports and computations. Please use separate cells”?

A: You should not have cells that are not exported, *and* contain a mix
of `import` statements along with other code. For instance, don’t do
this in a single cell:

``` python
import some_module
some_module.something()
```

Instead, split this into two cells, one which does `import some_module`,
and the other which does `some_module.something()`.

The reason for this is that when we create your documentation website,
we ensure that all of the signatures for functions you document are up
to date, by running the imports, exported cells, and
[`show_doc`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/showdoc.html#show_doc) functions in
your notebooks. When you mix imports with other code, that other code
will be run too, which can cause errors (or at least slowdowns) when
creating your website.

### Q: Someone told me not to use notebooks for “serious” software development!

A: [Watch this video](https://youtu.be/9Q6sLbz37gk). Don’t worry, we
still get this too, despite having used `nbdev` for a wide range of
“very serious” software projects over the last three years, including
[deep learning libraries](https://github.com/fastai/fastai), [API
clients](https://github.com/fastai/ghapi), [Python language
extensions](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore), [terminal user
interfaces](https://github.com/nat/ghtop), and more!
